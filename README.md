# Recursion: Backtracking
## Objectives

* See how the choice of data structures can affect the efficiency of a program
## Outline
* Example 1: Permutation
* Permutation Extension: Iterative
* Performance Evaluation
* Keys of Backtracking
* Example 2: N-Queens Problem
## Permutation
* A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of these objects. 
* An ordered arrangement of r elements of a set is called an ùëü -permutation.
  - A string of length n has n! permutation
* The number of r - permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by P(n, r)
  - The 2-permutations of ùëÜ ‡µå ·àº1,2,3·àΩ are 1,2; 1,3; 2,1; 2,3; 3,1; and 3,2. Hence, ùëÉ(3,2) = 6
  - P(n, r) = n(n-1)... (n -r + 1) = n!/(n-r)

* Question
  - Given a string without duplicated characters, retuen all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.
  - Example:
    - Input: str = "ABC"
    - Output: "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CBA", "CAB"
* A recursive strategy
  - For each char ch, swap it with each of other char on the right
    - After swapping, this is a new permutation
    - Then fix this char ch, and look for other permutations
  - Keep doing this for other char on the right

## Permutation Extension
* It is always true that recursion can be replaced by iteration and stacks
  - This iterative solution will work the same as what just happened in the call stack dor a recursive solution
  - Look at the recursion tree and call stack

* Can you develop an iterative solution for permutation
  - make a try
    - this is a bit challenging
    - but this will help improving your skills
  - Optional
## Analysis of Backtracking
* Just think about the property of permutation
  - A string of length n! permutation
* The time complexity is above n!
  - This algorithm is very slow
  - This function grows the fastest, among which we have learned in Discrete Structures
    - Evaluation function grows fast means the algorithm is slow
  - This is required by the problem naturally
## Keys of Backtracking
* Backtracking algorithms
  - search for a solution by
    - constructing partial solutions that remain consistent with the requirements of the problem, and then
    - extending a partial solution toward completion
    - And recovering to peer partial solution could be needed
  - When inconsistency occurs, the algorithms backs up (backtracks) by
    - removing the most recently constructed part of the solution, and then
    - trying another possibility
## Eight-Queens Puzzle
* How to place eight queens on a chess board so that no queen can take another
  - Remember that in chess, a queen can take another piece that lies on the same row, column or the same diagnol

* Solutions do exist
  - requires luck coupled with trial and error
  - exhaustive computation

* How will you solve the problem?
  - Put the queens on the board one by one in some systematic/logical order
    - Make sure that you will not revisit the same situation
    - The whole process is suitable for recursive programming
      - A large problem can be divided into small subproblems with a similar nature
  - Make sure that the queen placed will not be taken by another already on the board
  - If you are lucky to put eight queens on the board, one solution is found
  - Otherwise, some queens need to be removed and placed elsewhere to continue the search for a solution
* How to find the next square to try?
  - There must be a queen, exactly one in each row
    - There can never be more than one queen in a row
  - Therefore we can place the queens one row at a time in order
    - What we have decided is actually a systematic way to solve the problem

  - It is proved to be an unsolved problem 
* A refinement
  - keep track of unguarded squares by using three bool array: col_free, upward_free, downward_free
    - Diagonals from th elower lefr to the upper left area called upwards diagonals

## Self Test
* Can you get all possible r-combinations?
  - An r-combination of elements of a set is an unordered selection of r elements from the set
  - An r-combination is simply a subset of the set r elements
  - The number of ùëü -combinations of a set with n distinct elements is denoted by C(n, r),  or (n r) (supposed to be a column, rather than a row)
    - The 2-combinations of set S = {a, b, c, d} are {a,b}, {a,c}, {a,d}, {b,c}, {b,d} and {c,d}. Hence C(n,r) = 6
