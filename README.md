# Recursion: Backtracking
## Objectives
* Understand backtracking algorithms and use them to solve problems
* Use recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms
* See how the choice of data structures can affect the efficiency of a program
## Outline
* Example 1: Permutation
* Permutation Extension: Iterative
* Performance Evaluation
* Keys of Backtracking
* Example 2: N-Queens Problem
## Permutation
* A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of these objects. 
* An ordered arrangement of r elements of a set is called an ùëü -permutation.
  - A string of length n has n! permutation
* The number of r - permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by P(n, r)
  - The 2-permutations of ùëÜ ‡µå ·àº1,2,3·àΩ are 1,2; 1,3; 2,1; 2,3; 3,1; and 3,2. Hence, ùëÉ(3,2) = 6
  - P(n, r) = n(n-1)... (n -r + 1) = n!/(n-r)

* Question
  - Given a string without duplicated characters, retuen all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.
  - Example:
    - Input: str = "ABC"
    - Output: "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CBA", "CAB"
* A recursive strategy
  - For each char ch, swap it with each of other char on the right
    - After swapping, this is a new permutation
    - Then fix this char ch, and look for other permutations
  - Keep doing this for other char on the right

## Permutation Extension
* It is always true that recursion can be replaced by iteration and stacks
  - This iterative solution will work the same as what just happened in the call stack dor a recursive solution
  - Look at the recursion tree and call stack

* Can you develop an iterative solution for permutation
  - make a try
    - this is a bit challenging
    - but this will help improving your skills
  - Optional
